# Hello Team!  
  
This is our main codebase. If you can see this, make sure to add a text file titled with your name into the roll call folder. This should ensure that everyone has proper edit permissions and avoid hassle down the line. I also added some proposed workflows and methods for keeping track of what we have done and where we are in the code review process. Please give this a look over. If you have some different ideas or think that our MVP should look different, let me know.  
  
As a final note, remember to add JavaDoc comments to your code. We are going to have to have documentation for a later milestone, so its better to have it now then not.
  
Thanks!
